= MonoCAM is: =
 * a CAD program - you can design and manipulate points, curves, and surfaces
 * a CAM program - you can calculate and output toolpaths for cnc-machines
 * Open-Source, licensed under GPLv2
 * written in C#/mono, so it's cross-platform

= Technologies/Software used = 
 * mono
 * tao
 * c#
 * OpenGL

= Architecture =

[MonoCAMArchitecture] describes plans for the program architecture.
 * GUI
 * [CAM]
 * [GEO]
 * TOOLLIB
 * CUTSIM
