#summary Drop-cutter algorithm.

Back to [CAM]

Some definitions:
 # C(R,r) is a cutter with shaft radius R and corner radius r
 # CL point = Cutter location point. The position of the cutter.
 # CC point = Cutter contact point. Where the cutter touches the model.

= Introduction =
The basic idea is to drop down a cutter along the z-axis until it touches the triangulated model. This is done by testing the cutter against all triangles and then choosing the highest found CL point.

= Basic tests =
Each triangle has once facet, three vertices and three edges. so there are three tests to be performed.
  # vertex test for the vertices
  # facet test 
  # edge test for the three edges

= Optimizations =
