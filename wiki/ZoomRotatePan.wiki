#summary zooming rotating and panning the camera

We are locating the camera with the gluLookAt function:
 gluLookAt(cam.x , cam.y, cam.z, center.x, center.y, center.z, up.x, up.y, up.z)
this positions the camera at (cam.x , cam.y, cam.z) and it is pointed to look at the point (center.x, center.y, center.z). It is oriented so that camera up is in the direction (up.x, up.y, up.z)

It makes sense to internally represent the position of the camera in [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SphericalCoordinates.html spherical coordinates]
 (r, theta, fi)
The transformation from spherical coords to cartesian is:
 cam.x = r * cos(theta) * sin(fi)
 cam.y = r * sin(theta) * sin(fi)
 cam.z = r * cos(fi)
